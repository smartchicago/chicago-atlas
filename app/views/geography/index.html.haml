%p 
The Chicago Health Atlas is a place where you can view citywide information about health trends and take action near you to improve your own health.

%p
We display large amounts of data from sources like the City of Chicago and local hospitals so you can get big-picture views of health outcomes in Chicago. For example, you can browse data for neighborhood and zip code-level rates of diabetes, births, and homicides. 

%p
Then we show you concrete ways you can improve your own health in light of these outcomesâ€” from healthy eating classes to neo-natal care clinics to places you can turn in weapons.

%p
This way, we can be better informed about health in our city and take greater control of our own health, right in our own neighborhoods.
