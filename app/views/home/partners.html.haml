      %b Our partners are the cornerstone of Chicago Health Atlas. 
      Initially, the Atlas was built on an existing partnership by informatics researchers at five major academic health centers in Chicago:

      and

        %a{:href => 'http://www.rushu.rush.edu/'}Rush University
      Since that time, the Atlas has been expanded to include data and researchers from the Chicago Department of Public Health and soon, community-based organizations and other data contributing entities. The Atlas is a growing organic tool that relies heavily on partner participation and we are eager to continue this work with

          Early in the planning process, we recognized the need to maintain the anonymity of the patients, as well as the care providers, while retaining patient uniqueness. Dr. Malin’s expertise was critical to advise and audit the development process of re-identification risk. Dr. Malin has compared the performance of the hashing and matching software across institutions using the gold standard of an internal Enterprise Master Patient Index used for routine clinical care. He continues to audit and oversee aspects of data collection and maintenance according to HIPAA and IRB regulations.

          One of the key initiatives of Healthy Chicago is for the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) to make epidemiologic data available electronically so that Chicago’s residents, community organizations, researchers, students, and members of the media have flexibility in defining and answering questions, and engaging in public health problem-solving.  CDPH’s Epidemiology and Public Health Informatics Program collaborates in the Chicago Health Atlas by supplying public health indicator data sets via the City Data Portal and supporting efforts to visualize the data in ways that are most meaningful.
