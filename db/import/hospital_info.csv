The increase is because 2 rooms are now shared between venous access, interventional radiology and cardiac cath lab to improve patient flow.  2.

Over the course of CY12, UIMCC redefined the ethnicity data within the registration system to assure consistency of data transfer and reporting. As a result of this migration, the CY12 data reflects an increase from Hispanic or Latino to Non-Hispanic or Latino.    Part I, Question IIIA: Surgical Procedures – Invasive, Non OR, Dedicated Surgical Procedure Rooms. Inpatient pain management activity is performed in the operating room and not in a dedicated inpatient procedure room. Therefore, UIMCC has reported inpatient pain management procedures and hours within General Surgery in Question III: Surgical Procedures – Main O.R.    Part I, Question VIII: Emergency/Trauma Care - C. Type of the Trauma Center: UIMCC is a level 2 trauma center for adults and pediatrics. The AHQ survey only allows for the selection of adult or pediatrics.    Part I, Question VIII: Emergency/Trauma Care – E. Trauma Visits and Trauma Admissions to Hospital: According to Illinois Department of Public Health Emergency Medical Systems and Highway Safety website, UIMCC is not listed as a trauma center and therefore does not have to report trauma visits and admissions.     Part I, Question XI. Diagnostic and Therapeutic Equipment - Radiation Therapy Treatment Courses: Per AHQ instructions, UIMCC has identified Radiation Therapy treatment courses as examinations.     Part II, Question 3 Actual Cost of Services Provided to Charity Care inpatients and outpatients during your reported fiscal year: Per AHQ instructions, the reporting entity must report the actual cost of services provided based on the total cost to charge ratio derived from the hospital's Medicare cost report (CMS 2552-96 Worksheet C, Part 1, PPS Inpatient Ratios). Following those instructions, UIMCC’s reported total cost of services for inpatient and outpatient services is $14,037,150. UIMCC would like to indicate that on UIMCC’s audited financial statements for FY2012, the total cost of services provided to charity care was $17,806,000. The cost figure on the audited financial statement is different because it is calculated utilizing a cost accounting methodology which allocates full cost and is not derived from the cost to charge ratio from the Medicare Cost Report which includes only “allowable costs” as defined by the Medicare program.    Part II, Question 4 Community Benefit: As a state-owned entity, the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago has been exempt from Community Benefits Act (Public Act 93-480) which mandates all non-profit hospitals to report community benefit. At this time UIMCC is in the process of establishing a methodology for identifying community benefit and is reporting Community Benefits as Not Available.",,David Loffing,Chief Operating Officer,41351
